# Cloud Torrent Reliability Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Cloud Torrent application to address reliability issues, memory management problems, and performance bottlenecks.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Memory Management

- **Configurable Memory Limits**: Added memory usage tracking and configurable limits to prevent RAM exhaustion
- **Concurrent Download Limiting**: Implemented limits on simultaneous torrent downloads to prevent resource saturation
- **Buffer Management**: Added configurable buffer sizes to optimize memory usage during downloads

### 2. Download Reliability

- **Health Monitoring**: Added automatic health checking of torrents to detect and recover stalled downloads
- **Stall Detection**: Implemented detection of stalled downloads with automatic recovery
- **Error Tracking**: Added detailed error tracking and reporting for each torrent

### 3. Metadata Communication

- **Improved Metadata Tracking**: Enhanced tracking of metadata loading progress
- **Detailed Status Information**: Added comprehensive status information for each torrent and file
- **Enhanced Status API**: Created new API endpoints to get detailed status information

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Bandwidth Management**: Added configurable rate limiting for uploads and downloads
- **Peer Connection Management**: Improved peer connection handling with configurable limits
- **File System Optimizations**: Enhanced file serving with buffered I/O and better handling of large files
- **Directory Processing**: Improved directory handling for large torrent directories

### 5. Error Handling & Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging for critical operations
- **Error Recovery**: Implemented automatic retry logic for failed operations

## Configuration Options

The following new configuration options have been added:

```go
// Memory management
MaxMemoryUsage        int64 // Maximum memory usage in bytes (0 = unlimited)
MaxConcurrentTorrents int   // Maximum number of torrents to download simultaneously (0 = unlimited)
BufferPerTorrent      int64 // Buffer size per torrent in bytes

// Performance tuning
MaxConnectionsPerTorrent int     // Maximum number of connections per torrent (0 = use default)
MaxDownloadRate          int64   // Maximum download rate in bytes/sec (0 = unlimited)
MaxUploadRate            int64   // Maximum upload rate in bytes/sec (0 = unlimited)
WriteBufferSize          int     // Write buffer size in KB
ReadCacheSize            int     // Read cache size in MB

// Reliability settings
EnableAutoRetry     bool    // Auto retry failed downloads
MaxRetries          int     // Maximum number of retries per chunk
RetryBackoffFactor  float32 // Exponential backoff factor for retries
HealthCheckInterval int     // Health check interval in seconds (0 = disabled)
```

## New API Endpoints

### Detailed Torrent Status

```
POST /api/status
Body: [torrent infohash]
```

Returns detailed status information for a specific torrent including:
- Download progress and rate
- Health status
- Connected peers
- File details
- Error history

### System Health Status

```
POST /api/health
```

Returns overall health information for the torrent engine:
- Total active torrents
- Memory usage
- System uptime
- Resource utilization

## Best Practices

1. **Configure Memory Limits**: Set the `MaxMemoryUsage` to a value appropriate for your system (e.g., 50-70% of available RAM)
2. **Limit Concurrent Downloads**: Use `MaxConcurrentTorrents` to limit the number of simultaneous downloads based on your system resources
3. **Monitor Health**: Use the `/api/health` endpoint to monitor system health
4. **Use Bandwidth Throttling**: Configure download/upload rate limits to prevent network saturation

## Future Improvements

1. **Disk caching layer** for better handling of very large torrents
2. **Better progress visualization** in the UI
3. **Individual torrent prioritization** to prioritize important downloads
4. **Automatic system resource adjustment** based on monitoring data
