# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future improvements and features for Cloud Torrent. These are ideas that could be implemented to enhance the functionality, usability, and performance of the application.

## Core Features

### Remote Backends

The `0.9` branch is working towards making Cloud Torrent a more general-purpose cloud transfer engine. This would allow transferring files between different storage backends, not just from torrents to local disk.

Potential backends could include:
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3
- **FTP/SFTP**: Remote file servers
- **WebDAV**: Web-based remote file systems
- **NAS**: Network attached storage systems

This would make Cloud Torrent a unified interface for moving data between any source and destination.

### File Transforms

During file transfers, various transformations could be applied to the data:

- **Video Transcoding**: Convert videos to different formats or qualities using ffmpeg
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Secure files during transfer or storage
- **Media Sorting**: Automatically organize media files based on metadata
- **Compression**: Create zip/tar archives of downloaded content
- **Metadata Processing**: Extract and process metadata from files

### Automatic Updates

Implement a mechanism for the binary to update itself, ensuring users always have the latest features and security fixes.

### RSS Feed Support

Add support for automatically adding torrents from RSS feeds, with filtering capabilities:
- Episode filters for TV shows
- Quality preferences
- Regex-based filtering
- Scheduling for periodic checks

## User Interface Improvements

### Mobile App

Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android to control Cloud Torrent remotely.

### Enhanced Web UI

- Improved file browsing with preview capabilities
- Drag-and-drop torrent uploading
- Better search interface with filters
- Dark mode and customizable themes
- Responsive design improvements

### Desktop Integration

- System tray application for desktop platforms
- Native desktop notifications
- Download/upload speed controls

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimization

- HTTPS improvements
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Scalability

- Distributed downloading across multiple nodes
- Cluster support for high-availability deployments
- Load balancing for handling many concurrent users

## Integrations

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of these features will follow this general priority:

1. **Core Engine Rewrite**: Create a flexible architecture that supports multiple backends
2. **File Transforms**: Implement the transform pipeline
3. **RSS Support**: Add automated downloading from feeds
4. **UI Improvements**: Enhance the web interface
5. **Integrations**: Add support for external services
